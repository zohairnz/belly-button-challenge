# belly-button-challenge
In this activity, we built an interactive dashboard to explore a Belly Button Diversity dataset. The features of the dashboard include:
1.	A drop-down menu to select a test subject for which the data will display
2.	A panel that shows the demographic info of the test subject
3.	A horizontal bar chart that shows the top ten OTUs found in the test subject
4.	A bubble chart showing a larger bubble size for a larger sample value
